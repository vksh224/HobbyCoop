Welcome to Hobby Cooperative! This is a web application dedicated to facilitate
 tool and equipment sharing within a community, both benefitting novice
 hobbyists by providing them with inexpensive experience with the tools they
 need, and equipment owners by giving them a little extra cash.

For installation instructions for deploying Hobby Cooperative on your own,
 please refer to the INSTALL.pdf file. It'll provide you with the instructions
 needed to install both the Hobby Cooperative server and webpages.

Thank you for your interest. Now, let's get to building!
